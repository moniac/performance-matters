### Filesize

* I ran all the CSS through a minifier to reduce filesize.
* Ditto for the JS
* Compressed all the images to a much smaller filesize

### Critical CSS

* I used https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/ to check the critical css and pasted this inline into the index.html

### Fonts

* I added the font-display: swap;, so that the fallback font gets used first and then swapped to the webfont.
