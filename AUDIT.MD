## Changes

### Filesize

* I ran all the CSS through a minifier to reduce filesize.
* Ditto for the JS
* Compressed all the images to a much smaller filesize

### Convert

* I converted all the images to WEBP

### Critical CSS

* I used https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/ to check the critical css and pasted this inline into the index.html

### Fonts

* I added the font-display: swap;, so that the fallback font gets used first and then swapped to the webfont.

### Lazy Loading

* I added lazyloading to help on slower networks. Now images will only be loaded when it is in view.

If we look at these two images, you can see that the right one takes a full 3 seconds longer than the left one. Why is that you may wonder? One word. Extensions.

Extensions are amazing and lovely, but I forgot that some of them inject their own Javascript (and sometimes jQuery).

Testing without extensions saved me from a lot of frustrations ðŸ˜©
